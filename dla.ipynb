    "\n",
    "Fractals are fascinating patterns that exhibit *self-similarity* across different scales, meaning they look similar no matter how much you zoom in or out. These complex structures appear both in mathematics and nature, displaying shapes and dimensions that often fall between whole numbers. In essence, **a fractal is an infinite area contained within a finite amount of space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Fractals?\n",
    "- **Self-similar patterns**: Fractals repeat at different scales.\n",
    "- **Finite yet infinite**: They occupy finite space but contain infinite detail.\n",
    "- **Examples in nature**: Snowflakes, coastlines, plant structures, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fractals are typically created by repeating a simple process that generates intricate shapes. This concept is illustrated by **Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA)**, a process that generates complex branching patterns resembling fractals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA)** is a process that forms intricate, branching patterns as particles undergo random motion and cluster together upon contact. This motion, known as *Brownian motion*, represents the unpredictable movement of particles within a medium. DLA is relevant to any system where diffusion is the primary mode of transport and can lead to fractal-like formations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DLA Applications in Nature**:\n",
    "  - **Mineral deposits**: DLA can be observed in the formation of mineral aggregates.\n",
    "  - **Bacterial growth**: Bacteria colonies sometimes form fractal patterns as they spread.\n",
    "  - **Mountain ranges and coastlines**: Geographical features that can exhibit DLA-like structures.\n",
    "  - **Lung tissue**: The branching structure of alveoli in lungs resembles DLA patterns.\n",
    "  - **Corals formation**: Coral growth relies on environmental factors that can create a form of \"randomness\" .\n",

    "### How DLA Forms Fractals\n",
    "\n",
    "The DLA fractal formation process begins with a *‚Äúseed‚Äù particle* placed at a fixed location, surrounded by free-moving particles. The process unfolds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Motion**: Particles move randomly (Brownian motion) until they encounter and attach to the seed or an existing cluster.\n",
    "2. **Cluster Growth**: Each new particle follows the same process, gradually enlarging the cluster.\n",
    "3. **Formation of Branches**: Regions with larger protrusions grow faster, causing the structure to develop a tree-like, branching shape rather than a uniform circular form.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"README_files/Explanatory_illustration.png\" style=\"width:640px; height:auto;\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This method produces what are known as **‚ÄúBrownian trees‚Äù**‚Äîmathematical models that represent dendritic (branching) structures often seen in natural fractals.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *In summary, DLA offers a captivating way to observe fractal formation, illustrating how simple random processes can lead to beautiful, self-similar structures found both in mathematics and the natural world.*\n",

    "Fractal formation through Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) has numerous applications in biology. One important application is in understanding the evolution of gene promoter networks (GPNs), as studied in *\"Diffusion-Limited Aggregation and the Fractal Evolution of Gene Promoter Networks\"* by Preston R.

    "  - **Edges**: Weighted to show the degree of base-pair sharing between promoters.\n",

    "- **Symmetry**: GPN nuclei often show strong visual symmetry.\n",
    "- **Central Vacancy**: A central empty region suggests the presence of repulsive forces that influence promoter positioning.\n",
    "- **Fractal Topology**: The nuclei have a fractal structure, confirmed through box-covering and network-coloring methods.\n",
    "- **Fractal Dimension**: The average fractal dimension of GPN nuclei is \\( d = 1.731 \\).\n",

    " A set of n promoters is generated by drawing F base pairs for each promoter from a uniform distribution of bases (A, C, G, T). \n",
    "  - **Nodes**: Represent promoters.\n",
    " - **Edges**: Established based on the similarity between promoter pairs, calculated by counting shared base pairs.\n",
    "2. **Network Analysis Using Python**  \n",
    " Python and the NetworkX library are used to construct and analyze gene promoter networks (GPNs).\n",
    "   - A custom script was implemented to apply the renormalization technique to calculate the fractal dimension of the largest components of the network.\n",
    "3. **Fractal Dimension Calculation**  \n",
    "   The renormalization process involves a graph-coloring method adapted from box-covering in fractal analysis:\n",
    "   - For each box length \\( l_b \\) (shortest path between nodes), nodes are colored such that neighbors of the same color are within a distance \\( l_b \\).\n",
    "   - Nodes sharing the same color are collapsed into a single node, ensuring that adjacent nodes differ in color.\n",
    "   - The minimum number of boxes \\( N_b \\) of length \\( l_b \\) needed to cover the graph is recorded as the node count after renormalization.\n",
    "4. **Fractal Dimension Determination**  \n",
    "   By varying box lengths \\( l_b \\) and plotting \\( l_b \\) against \\( N_b \\) on a log-log scale:\n",
    "   - A linear trend indicates a fractal topology.\n",
    "   - The fractal dimension \\( d_b \\) is derived from the slope of this log-log plot, confirming the fractal structure of the network.\n",
